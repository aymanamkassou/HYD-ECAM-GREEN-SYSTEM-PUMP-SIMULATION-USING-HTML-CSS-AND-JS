# HYDECAM
A hard-coded simulation of the HYD ECAM page of the A320 series using HTML, CSS and JS using Jquery

I created this simple yet somewhat detailed simulation of the A320 HYD ECAM page, only the GREEN system is simulated. 
I made sure to include some intricate details. An example is the fluctuation of the pressure value for the GREEN hydraulic fluid.

It's worth nothing that there isn't a physical mathematical simulation of the hydraulic system, I hard coded the behaviour with reference from real world footage of the plane.
